# üìÖ Week 1: Danny‚Äôs Diner

!\[Alt text: Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.]

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat. The restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use their data to help run the business.
